still keep him? Let us leave him.

Yeah, of course.

Even your 6 month old kid.

I want to see you
laughing over their deaths.

What's the name of your kid, Jamal?

How did I forget?

136

Mohsin right?

00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,644
Congratulations!

138
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:37,664
Young Mohsin's going to be a martyr.

139
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:43,163
It's just that he doesn't know what
a big a****e his father is.

140
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:45,022
And, if you wanted
to see him die so soon...

141
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:47,292
why did bring him into this world
in the first place?

142
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,197
Yes!

143
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:57,700
- Makes Jamal's family stand right in the middle of the Mall.
- No.

144
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:00,474
Why is Mohsin crying?

145
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:05,602
Tell him... soon his
hunger will be satiated.

146
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,239
How about a live-telecast?

Why did you do it?

165
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,201
You were one of my own.

166
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:42,028
There are going to be so
many fireworks this year.

167
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:44,257
How many can you stop?

168
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,062
You can take him in.

169
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:55,745
Jamal!

170
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:14,178
How would I know that he will jump...

171
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:15,738
Damn it...

172
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:42,956
Bilal.

173
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:45,636
Someone's here from
your lawyer's office.

174
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,227
Needs you to sign something.

175
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:22,284
Go.

176
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:35,580
Greetings.

177
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:38,945
Greetings.

178
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:43,481
You called... ls everything okay?

179
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:46,659
Have you ever been in jail?

180
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:50,905
What about my bail?

181
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:53,785
They're trying...

182
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:55,267
Tell them to expedite.

183
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:58,433
Call +92...

184
00:22:58,724 --> 00:22:59,902
Tell them to get active.

185
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:01,484
Yes.

186
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:04,672
The ATS are starting
to connect the dots.

187
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,718
Yes, I will.

188
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:10,210
The Delhi Mission failed.

189
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:15,326
Amazing...

190
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:18,494
These guys can't even
keep their pants up...

191
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:20,923
and they dream to be Martyrs.

192
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:27,967
Taufiq bhai was asking...

193
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:33,472
the date's drawing closer.

194
00:23:34,532 --> 00:23:36,866
If you could tell us
where do we have to place the stuff.

195
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:43,676
Tell Taufiq if he's so concerned...

196
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,783
then first get me out of here.

197
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:50,971
I am not a**

198
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:59,007
I heard that Kasab
was given an A/C cell.

199
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:03,259
I've obviously done more than him.

200
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,340
Hello.

201
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:18,720
He isn't listening.

202
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,122
Says call up the neighbors first.

203
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,071
First he wants out of here.

204
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:24,986
Only then will He cooperate.

205
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:26,811
What?

206
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:45,757
Where they caught?

207
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:48,669
No, they attained salvation.

208
00:24:50,148 --> 00:24:52,090
Allah have mercy.

209
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,722
Do you know why our
these little efforts failing?

210
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:03,644
Allah wants us
to do something big.

211
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:05,698
Amen.

212
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:10,617
Take a trip to lndia, Javed.

213
00:25:11,204 --> 00:25:12,219
Yes.

214
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:17,151
It's time to get Bilal Khan out.

215
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,993
'Chants'

216
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,256
'Chants'

217
00:25:40,324 --> 00:25:43,488
'Chants'

218
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:46,371
'Chants'

219
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:49,470
'Chants'

220
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:53,118
'Chants'

221
00:25:54,308 --> 00:26:02,208
I started this mission
with the grace of Allah.

222
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,104
I just received news...

223
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:14,364
America's put a bounty...

224
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:19,132
of 10 million Dollars on my...
On Maulana Mohammad Rehman's head.

225
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:23,841
And lndia is really
happy to hear this.

226
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:27,513
I want to advice...

227
00:26:28,772 --> 00:26:34,620
America and
lndia on this occasion.

228
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:40,124
They should direct their
time... and their monies...

229
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:46,522
for their people.

230
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:52,612
Contribute it for the progress...

231
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:57,604
of our Muslim brothers
and sisters living in their countries.

232
00:26:58,468 --> 00:27:00,191
Because...

233
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,519
Mohammad Rehman...

234
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:08,643
cannot be caught...

235
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:13,439
until America
recedes from Pakistan...

236
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,101
and Kashmir recedes from lndia!

237
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:24,638
'Chants'

238
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,449
lndia claims that yesterday...

239
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:30,752
we killed some of
their men on the border.

240
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,412
'Chants'

241
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,680
'Chants'

242
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:37,755
'Chants'

243
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:43,195
What were they doing on our land?

244
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:50,080
This has always
been lndia's attitude.

245
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:53,305
They always project that
it's entirely our mistake.

246
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:57,635
'Chants'

247
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,010
'Chants'

248
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:06,077
'Chants'

249
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:10,010
'Chants'

250
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:22,132
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

251
00:28:22,212 --> 00:28:22,943
Have a seat, Feroz.

252
00:28:23,012 --> 00:28:24,012
Thank you, sir.

253
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:26,303
It was close.

254
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:29,280
What was Rakesh doing in lstanbul?

255
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,641
We had an agent Jamal,
who turned rogue.

256
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:36,059
He was recruiting for
Lashkar and lslamic Jihad.

257
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,490
Rakesh was on a mission to finish him.

258
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:40,254
But Jamal got better of him.

259
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:42,977
You're making quite a
good habit of all this, Feroz.

260
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:44,477
You saved lives.

261
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,013
Their failures...

262
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:49,123
Their continuous failure
is very soon going to demoralize them.

263
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,430
Congratulations.

264
00:28:51,428 --> 00:28:52,476
Congrats, Feroz.

265
00:28:52,547 --> 00:28:54,817
With due respect,
sir, I beg to differ.

266
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:56,251
With which part?

267
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:57,666
They're not failing, sir.

268
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,898
Jamal was my man.

269
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:01,916
He worked under me.

270
00:29:02,404 --> 00:29:03,745
It's our failure...

271
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:06,175
that he left us and
joined the enemy.

272
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,994
Jamal was a traitor.

273
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:09,505
It's not that simple.

274
00:29:09,923 --> 00:29:11,516
Jamal was an lndian.

275
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,372
The point being?

276
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:16,291
In the Taj attack,
the man who gave out instructions...

277
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,422
from Karachi's control room,
Zabi-Uddin-Ansari...

278
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,645
known as Abu Jindal,
also known as Abu Hamza...

279
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:25,250
is not a Pakistani.

280
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,770
He's an lndian by birth.

281
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,333
These terrorist organizations
have succeeded...

282
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:34,048
in convincing people,
that lndia is not their country.

283
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:38,298
And to act against it,
by using their religion as tool.

284
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:41,794
And now, our children
are being recruited...

285
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,588
from right under our noses,
for terrorist training camps.

286
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,270
And after completing
their training...

287
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,821
they come back
from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Nepal.

288
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:56,921
Using Facebook and Twitter...

289
00:29:57,348 --> 00:29:59,006
anyone can trigger a riot...

290
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,528
in any part of our country
right from his sitting desk.

291
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:05,214
What they couldn't achieve
from the outside.

292
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:08,253
Is now getting initiated from within.

293
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:12,257
And the bitter truth is, if
the members of the community feel...

294
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:15,619
they do not belong here,
and they're losing faith in us.

295
00:30:16,804 --> 00:30:17,804
Then...

296
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:22,363
that is the terrorist
organization's biggest success...

297
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,351
and our biggest failure, sir.

298
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:35,872
Greetings, brother.

299
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,184
Greetings.

300
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:38,654
Greetings.

301
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:43,706
Please come.

302
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,143
Why didn't you call?

303
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,408
I thought I'll surprise you.

304
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:31,325
You're still awake.

305
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:33,021
Was reading something.

306
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:35,194
I missed you.

307
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,789
I missed you too.

308
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:41,148
When will you stop lying?

309
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:55,298
Arjun doesn't...

310
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,525
but this naughty one keeps
asking of you all the time.

311
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:13,884
I need a drink.

312
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:15,101
You'll have something?

313
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:16,172
No!

314
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,275
- How was your...
- Conference?

315
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:20,954
Same old... boring.

316
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:22,650
Come, I'll tell you.

317
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:29,954
The presentation
was on the 3rd Day.

318
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:33,410
Mr. Shukla was fiddling
with the computer.

319
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:35,234
But he couldn't turn it on.

320
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,056
He started sweating.

321
00:32:38,147 --> 00:32:39,358
People were
wondering what's wrong.

322
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:41,021
I was wondering too.

323
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:44,610
Later we realized that
Mr. Shukla...

324
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:46,910
hasn't pressed the power button.

325
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,841
Why do you always make up a story?

326
00:32:53,444 --> 00:32:55,899
I can understand, you
can't share your work with me.

327
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:01,634
You'll need a story,
it's important.

328
00:33:04,227 --> 00:33:05,307
Why?

329
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:09,952
What if I don't return someday?

330
00:33:12,611 --> 00:33:14,553
There must be some story about me.

331
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:18,431
For Arjun, you... Ananya.

332
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:20,063
Our friends.

333
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:22,587
You know how it is.

334
00:33:23,011 --> 00:33:24,011
Shut up!

335
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,525
I told you let's not get married.

336
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:31,135
Yes, and when I said let's not...

337
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,851
then why did you keep chasing me?

338
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,160
I didn't want to lose you.

339
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:42,108
I don't love you.

340
00:33:54,372 --> 00:34:00,700
"I don't... love you."

341
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:06,784
"I don't... love you."

342
00:34:06,852 --> 00:34:13,082
"But every single evening..."

343
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:21,155
"I wait for you."

344
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:32,413
"I don't... love you."

345
00:34:32,516 --> 00:34:39,706
"But the day you're not here..."

346
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:45,728
"The city seems strange."

347
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:52,095
"Every bud looks unknown."

348
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:59,098
"Everything feels unfamiliar."

349
00:34:59,204 --> 00:35:03,033
"I love you."

350
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:11,614
The hearing on Jamshed Rashid,
aka Bilal Khan's case just ended.

351
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:12,698
Today's case was dismissed...

352
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:15,106
due to absence of witnesses.

353
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:18,203
The next hearing
is on 4th of the next month.

354
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:19,901
And as you can see, behind me...

355
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:41,564
Yes.

356
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:43,681
The van is coming.

357
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,923
Stay there.

358
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:55,354
Stay there.

359
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:33,708
Hello.

360
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:41,212
In breaking news... Bilal Khan...

361
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:45,090
who was arrested last month from
Nagpur for a serial blast case...

362
00:39:45,188 --> 00:39:47,162
has managed to flee from custody.

363
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:49,023
Okay.

364
00:39:49,124 --> 00:39:50,844
You are going to get a
day off school today.

365
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:52,224
- Yes.
- Okay.

366
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,468
Where are we going?

367
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,101
Shopping.

368
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:56,283
- Shopping.
- Shopping.

369
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:57,435
- Movie.
- Movie.

370
00:39:57,507 --> 00:39:58,401
- And then movie.
- Doremon.

371
00:39:58,467 --> 00:39:59,133
Doremon 2.

372
00:39:59,235 --> 00:40:01,057
- We'll go watch Doremon 2.
- Doremon 5.

373
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:04,254
And then we'll go have dinner.

374
00:40:04,355 --> 00:40:07,290
After lunch,
we'll go to the ice-skating rink.

375
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:09,153
We'll go for a picnic.

376
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:10,812
Okay then we'll go for a picnic.

377
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:13,117
We'll have great fun.

378
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,655
Yes, we'll have great fun.

379
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:18,335
Papa's phone is ringing again.

380
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:23,563
Yes.

381
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:27,035
On my way.

382
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:37,953
Just don't die.

383
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,208
Javed Khan is in Mumbai.

384
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:15,355
That explains?

385
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:17,500
Sir, that explains everything.

386
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:28,092
These are the Airport
CCTVfootage grabs.

387
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,537
Arrived from Dubai yesterday.

388
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:30,650
Is it him?

389
00:41:31,427 --> 00:41:32,540
That's him, sir.

390
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,552
- Is he under arrest?
- No.

391
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:36,925
ATS has received a tip,
they're waiting for us.

392
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,354
Come sir.

393
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:53,343
Sir, that's Aftab.

394
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:54,782
He's the one who tipped us.

395
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:58,239
Approached us after watching
the news about Bilal Khan's escape.

396
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,257
And that's his father.

397
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:02,443
Ajay.

398
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:16,729
Aftab, take a seat.

399
00:42:20,835 --> 00:42:22,045
How old are you?

400
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,671
Sir, I'm 23 years old.

401
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:26,875
Qualification?

402
00:42:28,163 --> 00:42:29,178
I'm an engineer, sir.

403
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,194
So you're both, cool and smart.

404
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,235
So tell me what do you want to share.

405
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:41,593
Sir, I was in FSC 2nd year,
engineering when all this started.

406
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:43,827
Sameer and Junaid were my friends.

407
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:46,590
And they introduced me to Taufiq bhai.

408
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,092
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

409
00:42:56,931 --> 00:43:00,280
Taufiq arranged some
private scholarships...

410
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:03,071
keeping my academic
performance in mind.

411
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:05,722
I thought I deserved it.

412
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:12,542
But soon after he called
me and showed me some videos.

413
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:17,050
Videos of...

414
00:43:17,315 --> 00:43:18,315
riots...

415
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:20,235
killings...

416
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:22,912
People getting slaughtered.

417
00:43:25,315 --> 00:43:26,428
I was shaken, sir.

418
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:31,195
Since that day,
I started receiving similar links...

419
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:35,618
on my Facebook,
Twitter and Gmail accounts.

420
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:38,589
The Assam link, Gujarat link and...

421
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:40,890
Many more.

422
00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:46,047
Around 6 months ago
I was called and told...

423
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:49,656
that I, Sameer and
Junaid along with 2 others...

424
00:43:50,051 --> 00:43:52,669
were going to Nepal
for special training.

425
00:43:53,122 --> 00:43:54,748
And we were also told that...

426
00:43:54,819 --> 00:43:56,542
we were chosen amongst thousands.

427
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:04,510
L...lied to mom and dad...

428
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:07,649
that we're going on a college trip.

429
00:44:12,035 --> 00:44:15,002
Right after landing at Kathmandu
airport we were taken to Rautahat.

430
00:44:24,835 --> 00:44:26,362
And after spending a night there...

431
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:29,696
we were loaded on to
a truck and taken to the border.

432
00:44:47,171 --> 00:44:49,854
Our training lasted for 2 weeks.

433
00:44:52,227 --> 00:44:56,089
We were trained to assemble
improvised explosive device.

434
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:14,240
When they conducted a test...

435
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:17,593
they all praised me.

436
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:19,835
Because I was the best.

437
00:45:21,379 --> 00:45:22,557
How were you be the best?

438
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:27,901
Sir, I know how to trigger a CWID,
VOID and RCID.

439
00:45:28,003 --> 00:45:29,345
Even if it's command-wire...

440
00:45:29,411 --> 00:45:32,477
radio, cellphone
or victim operated.

441
00:45:32,803 --> 00:45:34,265
I've learnt everything.

442
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,849
Sir, Taufiq bhai called
us yesterday for a meeting.

443
00:45:40,131 --> 00:45:42,717
Each of us was assigned a task.

444
00:45:43,522 --> 00:45:46,206
Some were supposed to deliver goods...

445
00:45:46,595 --> 00:45:49,083
while others were asked
to collect some stuff.

446
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:54,014
Sir, there is an 11
year old kid amongst us.

447
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:55,965
His name's lmran.

448
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:59,162
Sir, he's my uncle's son.

449
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,265
What would he know
what right or wrong?

450
00:46:05,283 --> 00:46:06,592
What are they planning?

451
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:09,984
I don't know, sir.

452
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:13,472
I only saw Bilal Khan's
photo in the meeting.

453
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:14,538
And...

454
00:46:16,003 --> 00:46:18,851
- This morning when I saw the news.
- Where's Bilal?

455
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,204
I don't know, sir.

456
00:46:23,811 --> 00:46:24,811
Where's Javed.

457
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:26,682
I don't know, sir.

458
00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:28,674
Last night few men arrived
from Pakistan.

459
00:46:28,675 --> 00:46:30,497
This is our small home.

460
00:46:30,562 --> 00:46:32,384
You can call it our headquarters.

461
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:37,978
Sameer told me that one of
them was Javed Khan.

462
00:46:38,402 --> 00:46:41,053
Only Taufiq bhai knows where they are.

463
00:46:41,474 --> 00:46:42,718
And where can I find Taufiq?

464
00:46:43,523 --> 00:46:44,537
Zeenat Mahal.

465
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:46,914
Sir, they need Bilal.

466
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:50,594
And... they're planning something big.

467
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:55,036
- Do you have any photo of Taufiq?
- Yes, sir.

468
00:46:57,155 --> 00:46:57,983
Sir...

469
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,149
9821311...

470
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:04,412
Sir...

471
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:14,080
Aftab, what you are doing needs
a lots of courage.

472
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:17,355
Look at me.

473
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:20,635
I'm proud of you.

474
00:47:21,763 --> 00:47:22,908
We're all proud of you.

475
00:47:28,162 --> 00:47:29,177
Good luck.

476
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:31,009
And cooperate with these guys.

477
00:47:31,075 --> 00:47:32,253
- Okay.
- Okay Sir.

478
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,391
So, Ajay, how do you want to do it?

479
00:47:36,194 --> 00:47:37,405
It's a small operation, sir.

480
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,458
I would like to lead
a small team of ATS' men.

481
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:40,779
Sounds good.

482
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:46,786
Yes, sir, I'll keep you posted, sir.

483
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:48,219
Okay sir.

484
00:47:50,371 --> 00:47:52,313
Is it anyone's happy birthday today?

485
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:53,596
- No.
- No, sir.

486
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:56,833
Sir, it's my marriage anniversary.

487
00:47:57,059 --> 00:47:58,074
How many years has it been, Gawde?

488
00:47:58,178 --> 00:47:59,178
16 years sir.

489
00:48:00,163 --> 00:48:01,504
If you have survived your
marriage of 16 years...

490
00:48:01,603 --> 00:48:02,530
you'll survive this too.

491
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:03,595
Don't worry.

492
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:06,267
Sir, with you around
we've got nothing to worry.

493
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,581
In fact, we enjoy it.

494
00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:11,872
Sir you don't recall but we were
together during the opera house ops.

495
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:13,756
Gawde, what happened
to your moustache?

496
00:48:14,883 --> 00:48:16,988
Sir because of the
marriage anniversary...

497
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:19,263
my wife asked me
to sport a clean look.

498
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:36,793
Move. Move.

499
00:48:39,362 --> 00:48:40,410
Move.

500
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,834
Move.

501
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:52,699
Uncle, where can I find Taufiq?

502
00:48:52,802 --> 00:48:54,810
- Taufiq? First floor.
- Thank you.

503
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:05,056
Stand aside.

504
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:09,538
ATS Mumbai.

505
00:49:09,922 --> 00:49:11,810
We need to have a small chat.

506
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:25,373
Let me tell you something.

507
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,189
These people love me a lot.

508
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:45,022
As long as you're here, they will stop
all work and keep standing outside.

509
00:49:45,987 --> 00:49:48,922
And the crowd outside
Zeenat Mahal will also keep growing.

510
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:52,573
So... what brings you here?

511
00:49:52,643 --> 00:49:55,009
Where are Bilal and Javed Ali Khan?

512
00:49:57,443 --> 00:49:59,482
What would you like to have?
Some tea, coffee, cold drink?

513
00:49:59,554 --> 00:50:01,394
Some other time,
I'm in a bit of a hurry today.

514
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,225
I just want two people,

515
00:50:03,523 --> 00:50:05,825
Where are Bilal and Javed Ali Khan?

516
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:10,587
Let me... tell you a small story.

517
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,505
Listen carefully.

518
00:50:14,275 --> 00:50:16,925
Remember the 2008 bomb blasts.

519
00:50:17,411 --> 00:50:19,866
Two days later the
police stormed at my place.

520
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:21,434
Someone tipped them that...

521
00:50:21,507 --> 00:50:23,743
some kids from
the lndian Mujahiddin...

522
00:50:24,098 --> 00:50:25,920
have sought refuge here.

523
00:50:26,978 --> 00:50:30,556
They interrogated me continuously for
three days in their own style.

524
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:32,448
But I didn't utter a word.

525
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,806
I knew! But no!

526
00:50:37,923 --> 00:50:40,061
Two days later, those kids...

527
00:50:40,322 --> 00:50:42,082
reached their destination,
safe and sound.

528
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:46,172
Some ba*** betrayed us, but not me.

529
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:52,060
You know that religion
column that we have?

530
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:57,728
I write Muslim, in Bold and Capital.

531
00:50:59,874 --> 00:51:02,208
And now about your question?

532
00:51:03,299 --> 00:51:04,641
Who Bilal?

533
00:51:06,434 --> 00:51:08,125
Who Javed Ali Khan?

534
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,170
Let me tell you a small story too.

535
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:14,328
I was in the Para-Military forces.

536
00:51:14,626 --> 00:51:17,725
We were deployed in
Gujarat's Hindu-Muslim riots.

537
00:51:18,691 --> 00:51:21,243
We received an alert,
that a Muslim family...

538
00:51:21,635 --> 00:51:23,096
comprising of mother, father,
13 year old kid...

539
00:51:23,203 --> 00:51:24,523
they were stuck in the interiors.

540
00:51:24,611 --> 00:51:27,840
And a radical Hindu militant
organization had got news of them.

541
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:30,689
My colleagues were occupied...

542
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,569
and since I was the closest,
I responded.

543
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:35,900
When I arrived at the location,
the family thought...

544
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:37,465
that I was there to kill them.

545
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,454
After a great difficulty
they were assured.

546
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:42,717
In the evening, the crowd
arrived waving the Hindutva flag...

547
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:44,958
with swords, guns and petrol bombs.

548
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:50,170
I fought alone... for 24 hours.

549
00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:52,511
I was also shot twice.

550
00:51:53,282 --> 00:51:55,071
Seven people were killed
by me that day.

551
00:51:55,874 --> 00:51:58,674
But I kept that family safe and didn't
allow one scratch on the family.

552
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:03,499
That religion column
that you were talking about..

553
00:52:04,323 --> 00:52:06,876
We write 'lndian'
in Bold and Capital there.

554
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:18,016
Look, if even get a scratch on me...

555
00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:19,202
Why would you get a scratch?

556
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:36,254
Come on.

557
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:38,078
Everyone, come on...

558
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:40,760
Everyone, come on...

559
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:41,867
Get down.

560
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:57,089
Everyone, come on...

561
00:52:57,539 --> 00:52:58,749
Come on.

562
00:53:04,898 --> 00:53:07,004
Sir he want to say something.

563
00:53:07,426 --> 00:53:08,953
- Are you sure?
- Yes sir.

564
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:17,406
Where's Bilal?

565
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,475
Where's Bilal?

566
00:53:22,018 --> 00:53:24,320
Only... Javed knows.

567
00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:25,596
Where's Javed?

568
00:53:29,346 --> 00:53:32,991
14... Raybury Road, William Docks.

569
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,745
- Did you record that?
- Yes, sir.

570
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:37,852
Stay back...- I said stay back...

571
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:40,921
Stay back...

572
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:44,092
- Stand here.
- Listen to me.

573
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:45,275
I said stay back...

574
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:46,556
Why are you coming forward?

575
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:47,673
Stay back...

576
00:53:48,163 --> 00:53:51,032
Taufiq, those people
are standing out there...

577
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:53,754
because they don't
know the truth about you.

578
00:53:54,338 --> 00:53:56,443
They don't know
that you're an lSl agent.

579
00:53:57,314 --> 00:54:00,696
If we don't find Javed
at this given address...

580
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:03,738
then we'll broadcast
this clipping on breaking news.

581
00:54:04,162 --> 00:54:07,261
And then we'll see how much
These guys really love you.

582
00:54:07,682 --> 00:54:08,958
Move.

583
00:54:31,459 --> 00:54:33,313
Move back.

584
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,166
Move. Move.

585
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:37,241
Move...

586
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:39,961
Move...

587
00:54:43,843 --> 00:54:44,606
Yes, Ajay.

588
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:45,721
Sir, we've an address.

589
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:46,826
We're heading there.

590
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,857
I'm sending you a video-clip, sir.
It's just an update.

591
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,305
And needs no action, sir.

592
00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:51,485
Are you okay?

593
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:52,914
Of course, sir.
I'll call you back.

594
00:54:53,026 --> 00:54:54,026
Good.

595
00:54:55,522 --> 00:54:57,431
Gawde, you have to throw
a party after this is over.

596
00:54:57,539 --> 00:54:58,619
Of course, sir.

597
00:55:19,746 --> 00:55:22,364
I reached there,
but he was stuck in traffic.

598
00:55:24,482 --> 00:55:25,791
Now not me...

599
00:55:48,322 --> 00:55:49,566
Usmaan!

600
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:21,687
Javed Khan, hands up.

601
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:26,877
- Gawde.
- Yes, sir.

602
00:56:27,523 --> 00:56:29,595
You wanted an anniversary present,
didn't you?

603
00:56:29,858 --> 00:56:32,247
- Will an imported one do?
- Of course, sir.

604
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:33,689
Take him in.

605
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:36,321
We need to show him our hospitality.

606
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:20,090
News has just come in
from William Dock, Mumbai...

607
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,650
where one of the most dreaded
terrorist Javed Ali, from LeT...

608
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:25,570
killed himself and 4 police
officers in a suicide explosion.

609
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:28,318
One officer was also reportedly
injured in the attack.

610
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:30,809
ATS Mumbai carried
out the operation...

611
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,791
led by a tip
and raided the compound.

612
00:58:32,898 --> 00:58:35,319
They were successful
in gunning down 8 terrorists.

613
00:58:55,362 --> 00:58:57,664
Excuse me sir, something to drink?

614
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:25,739
Firstly, Rehman sir...

615
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:28,525
the allegation made by lndia.

616
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,372
Regarding the recent
terrorist attacks...

617
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:33,228
and Bilal Khan's escape.

618
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:37,677
Your name always comes up
along with these incidents.

619
00:59:38,131 --> 00:59:39,920
What is your opinion about it?

620
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:44,690
India is a disturbed nation.

621
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:48,425
Rehman sir,
you didn't answer my question.

622
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:49,869
I did.

623
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:52,877
India is a disturbed nation!

624
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,024
Why is lndia disturbed?

625
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:56,844
It's their mind set.

626
00:59:57,588 --> 00:59:59,726
They're disturbed by Pakistan.

627
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,034
They're disturbed by me.

628
01:00:02,419 --> 01:00:04,492
Whenever anything wrong
happens in lndia...

629
01:00:04,595 --> 01:00:08,654
Pakistan and I get blamed for it.

630
01:00:09,203 --> 01:00:12,138
India has warned that
if we don't cooperate...

631
01:00:12,211 --> 01:00:13,040
they will launch
a surgical strike...

632
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:14,765
Bhaijaan!

633
01:00:16,692 --> 01:00:19,310
I know lndia.

634
01:00:20,436 --> 01:00:22,705
They can do nothing.

635
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:24,940
All they do is talk.

636
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:27,820
They shed tears and wail.

637
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:34,384
They can do nothing now,
and they never ever will. Lnsha allah.

638
01:01:01,843 --> 01:01:02,541
Yes, Sameer.

639
01:01:02,643 --> 01:01:03,756
Sir, please come down.

640
01:01:07,924 --> 01:01:08,924
Yes Sameer.

641
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:10,889
Sir, Javed's hard drive is on.

642
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,251
See.

643
01:01:14,483 --> 01:01:18,226
- Isn't that Wasim Sheikh?
- Yes, sir.

644
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:20,047
Last seen in Karachi, in 2011.

645
01:01:20,787 --> 01:01:23,918
But... according to lB he's dead.

646
01:01:24,275 --> 01:01:25,453
No, sir, lB's wrong.

647
01:01:25,523 --> 01:01:26,952
He's alive and is in Nepal.

648
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:28,876
His new name is Abdul Haq.

649
01:01:29,363 --> 01:01:32,014
And from out there he handles
recruitments for Lashkar and lM.

650
01:01:32,084 --> 01:01:33,938
And he also raises funds for Rehman.

651
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:36,425
Wasim and Javed were
in constant touch with him.

652
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:39,018
He is the one who funded Bilal's
rescue operation.

653
01:01:39,091 --> 01:01:40,717
These are few emails
shared between them.

654
01:01:41,235 --> 01:01:42,696
They have used childish code words.

655
01:01:42,771 --> 01:01:44,462
It took me less than
5 minutes to crack.

656
01:01:46,355 --> 01:01:47,533
CD means Revolver.

657
01:01:47,635 --> 01:01:49,130
DVD means Assault Rifles.

658
01:01:49,235 --> 01:01:50,991
Pen Drive means
Bullets and Detonators.

659
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:53,902
They used the word 'Dawaati' here.

660
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:55,727
It means preparation for blast.

661
01:01:56,275 --> 01:01:57,169
'Shaam' mean Delhi.

662
01:01:57,267 --> 01:01:58,412
'Musa' means Gujarat.

663
01:01:58,515 --> 01:01:59,562
'Baigu' means Bangalore.

664
01:01:59,668 --> 01:02:00,668
H is 'Hyderabad'.

665
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:03,403
They're planning something
really nasty and big.

666
01:02:03,923 --> 01:02:05,679
And Bilal is in-charge
of the operation.

667
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:09,933
In short, Wasim Sheikh has
all the answers to your questions.

668
01:02:10,323 --> 01:02:12,527
Can you find Wasim's
present location?

669
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,090
He is in Kathmandu.

670
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:16,211
He runs a Tours and
Travels business, as a front.

671
01:02:16,244 --> 01:02:18,684
I have been tracking his online
activities since this morning.

672
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:20,680
He spent two hours
on the internet.

673
01:02:20,788 --> 01:02:22,031
Primarily watching
lndian news sites...

674
01:02:22,131 --> 01:02:23,440
and on-line channels.

675
01:02:23,668 --> 01:02:25,806
Later, he made an online
transfer of 12,000...

676
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,217
to his family in Lucknow.

677
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:31,337
After that he Googled for
Sunny Leone's sexy wallpapers.

678
01:02:31,827 --> 01:02:33,387
And he was there for some time.

679
01:02:35,475 --> 01:02:37,068
Good job, Sameer. Well done.

680
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:38,491
Thank you sir.

681
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:41,169
What do you say, Ajay?

682
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:44,684
Sir let's get Wasim.

683
01:02:45,523 --> 01:02:47,323
If we go through the process,
it'll take ages.

684
01:02:47,571 --> 01:02:48,651
And if we inform
the local authorities...

685
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,934
the media will find out.

686
01:02:50,196 --> 01:02:51,406
Let's keep it discreet Sir.

687
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:55,280
- Did you hear Rehman's speech?
- Yes, sir. I did.

688
01:02:55,987 --> 01:02:57,132
It's our fault, sir.

689
01:02:58,035 --> 01:03:00,271
When the Americans
killed Osama in Abbottabad...

690
01:03:00,371 --> 01:03:01,833
some of our politicians
excitedly stated...

691
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:05,868
that, we should carry
out surgical strikes too.

692
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:07,215
To get Abdul Rehman...

693
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:08,712
But if only they had quietly
carried out the strike...

694
01:03:08,787 --> 01:03:10,097
instead of propagating it...

695
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:12,203
then today we would've
been in a better position.

696
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:14,191
How many do you need?

697
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,291
One!

698
01:03:15,764 --> 01:03:16,941
We'll do a honey trap,
sir and we need,

699
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:18,371
Ground support
for our safe return.

700
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,629
We will keep it very simple.
In and out.

701
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:21,900
Wasim will be our custody,
Before anyone knows.

702
01:03:22,419 --> 01:03:23,434
Sounds good.

703
01:03:24,947 --> 01:03:27,533
But... we'll have to inform
these imbeciles.

704
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:31,785
I just jot that down in my diary...

705
01:03:33,363 --> 01:03:34,443
Hold on.

706
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:38,139
Yes, Feroz sir.

707
01:03:38,195 --> 01:03:39,821
Mr. Gupta, how are you?

708
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,425
We need to see minister sir.

709
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,634
Sir is on a tight schedule.

710
01:03:43,731 --> 01:03:45,051
I suggest that you call tomorrow.

711
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:46,319
Forget it them.

712
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:48,265
We'll meet after the blasts.

713
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:49,339
Hello...

714
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:51,689
Please come, I'll arrange for it.

715
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:53,211
Yes.

716
01:03:55,091 --> 01:03:55,756
Nonsense...

717
01:03:55,859 --> 01:03:56,859
Yeah...

718
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:02,651
Have it.

719
01:04:06,227 --> 01:04:07,227
Just two more minutes.

720
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:09,388
The BBC people are here, so...

721
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:18,282
You see, sir has managed
to create a very peaceful ambience...

722
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:19,599
in the entire country.

723
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:21,874
Even the opposition is stunned...

724
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:23,731
about how he has got
things under control.

725
01:04:24,467 --> 01:04:26,223
Yes, it's only sir
who is doing everything!

726
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:28,749
You seem offended.

727
01:04:29,363 --> 01:04:30,770
Who's going to lead the way?

728
01:04:31,379 --> 01:04:32,688
Who's leading the way?

729
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:33,867
Face of change.

730
01:04:35,155 --> 01:04:36,780
Yeah, face of change? Who is it?

731
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,212
Of course, our Minister sir.

732
01:04:39,955 --> 01:04:41,296
You're taunting me now.

733
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:42,860
No, Mr. Gupta.

734
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:48,367
In just last week alone 24 of our
officers died collectively.

735
01:04:48,435 --> 01:04:51,152
But people are bound to die,
that's their job.

736
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,060
Yes, sir.

737
01:05:22,611 --> 01:05:23,756
Okay, sir.

738
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:26,929
Sir, this is our best
chance to find Bilal.

739
01:05:27,315 --> 01:05:28,592
Wasim is our best lead.

740
01:05:29,043 --> 01:05:31,629
- When?
- Ln the next 24 hours, sir.

741
01:05:32,115 --> 01:05:33,937
How will you do it
without telling Nepal?

742
01:05:34,195 --> 01:05:34,959
It'll be done, sir.

743
01:05:35,027 --> 01:05:36,827
We don't want to make
any noise about it, sir.

744
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:40,397
I can't sanction this Feroz.

745
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:42,608
Sir, nothing will
be official about it.

746
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,109
It'll be a covert operation.

747
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:45,420
If something goes wrong...

748
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:47,692
- we do not know Ajay.
- Yes sir.

749
01:05:50,419 --> 01:05:52,623
- What's the plan, Feroz?
- Sorry, sir.

750
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:54,427
What's the plan?

751
01:05:54,547 --> 01:05:55,976
I heard you the first time.

752
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:57,051
Sorry, sir.

753
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:07,952
Excuse me, Mr. Khan.

754
01:06:09,683 --> 01:06:11,276
Would you like me
to serve you some snacks?

755
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:12,873
No, thank you.

756
01:06:13,907 --> 01:06:14,954
Mrs. Khan?

757
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:16,780
I'll have a glass of juice.

758
01:06:16,883 --> 01:06:18,093
- Thank you.
- Sure ma'am.

759
01:06:20,915 --> 01:06:22,376
You were snoring, sir.

760
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:25,708
Stop being my wife.

761
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:10,348
Welcome sir.

762
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:17,070
Enjoy sir.

763
01:07:17,139 --> 01:07:18,382
Thank you.

764
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,456
- Take it.
- Thank you Sir.

765
01:08:24,019 --> 01:08:25,775
No need to stay
more than 5 minutes.

766
01:08:26,195 --> 01:08:28,399
Fix a meeting for tomorrow at 11,
in this hotel.

767
01:08:28,626 --> 01:08:29,837
Keep it straight and simple.

768
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:30,986
Okay? Good luck.

769
01:08:31,058 --> 01:08:32,058
Sir.

770
01:09:01,522 --> 01:09:03,694
- Hi Jayesh.
- How are you?

771
01:09:04,435 --> 01:09:05,435
I'm fine.

772
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:12,361
- We are on.
- Okay sir.

773
01:09:13,843 --> 01:09:15,469
- Tell me.
- I'm leaving now.

774
01:09:15,955 --> 01:09:17,646
- Call me in the evening.
- Okay.

775
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:22,671
- Sorry.
- No problem.

776
01:09:22,963 --> 01:09:26,607
Can you please guide
me to this address?

777
01:09:35,699 --> 01:09:36,844
Where are you from?

778
01:09:37,746 --> 01:09:39,023
Mumbai.

779
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:43,819
What for?

780
01:09:44,466 --> 01:09:46,321
To meet Mr. Abdul Haq.

781
01:09:47,027 --> 01:09:48,882
One of his contacts sent me here.

782
01:09:56,019 --> 01:09:57,019
Come.

783
01:10:11,154 --> 01:10:12,267
- Sorry.
- Alright.

784
01:11:29,075 --> 01:11:30,075
Sit.

785
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:32,112
Sit, I'll be right back.

786
01:12:42,867 --> 01:12:44,689
Abdul sahab is gone,
for a meeting.

787
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:46,767
I've left a message for him.

788
01:12:48,563 --> 01:12:51,148
So... how can I help you?

789
01:12:52,274 --> 01:12:53,289
No.

790
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:55,112
I want to talk to him.

791
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,385
Don't worry,
I am very close to him.

792
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:00,910
Who sent you?

793
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:04,105
I am here on behalf of Taufiq sahab.

794
01:13:05,106 --> 01:13:06,961
After his martyrdom,
I was instructed...

795
01:13:07,059 --> 01:13:09,841
to come here and handover
a package to Mr. Abdul.

796
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:11,625
Who sent you?

797
01:13:13,587 --> 01:13:14,863
They don't have names.

798
01:13:15,443 --> 01:13:16,653
I received a phone call...

799
01:13:16,755 --> 01:13:19,308
and next day I received
some money and tickets.

800
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:23,753
Are you alone?

801
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:25,552
No, Rafiq's with me.

802
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:28,137
We've been sent here
posing as husband-wife.

803
01:13:28,947 --> 01:13:29,947
Where's the packet?

804
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:31,819
At the hotel.

805
01:13:34,003 --> 01:13:35,497
How will you recognize Abdul sahab?

806
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:38,702
He will need to speak
to someone in lndia.

807
01:13:39,538 --> 01:13:41,058
After they are reassured, I'll know...

808
01:13:41,075 --> 01:13:42,675
whether to handover
the packet or not.

809
01:13:44,563 --> 01:13:48,873
Just... send him to this
hotel tomorrow at 11.

810
01:13:49,266 --> 01:13:49,964
Goodbye.

811
01:13:50,034 --> 01:13:51,034
Wait.

812
01:13:53,106 --> 01:13:55,146
I'm heading that way,
I'll drop you.

813
01:13:55,475 --> 01:13:56,620
No, it's alright.

814
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:00,396
- It's not a problem. Come on.
- No, it's okay.

815
01:14:00,467 --> 01:14:02,027
I said it's not a problem.

816
01:14:02,258 --> 01:14:03,687
Come on. Let's go.

817
01:14:51,826 --> 01:14:52,841
Sorry.

818
01:15:06,322 --> 01:15:07,599
Come. I am driving.

819
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:02,382
- What's your name?
- What?

820
01:16:03,122 --> 01:16:05,544
- Name?
- Shabana Kaif.

821
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:14,970
Yes, Rafiq.

822
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:15,983
What are you doing?

823
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,800
Yeah, it's alright. Bye.

824
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:23,817
Who was it?

825
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:26,505
Rafiq, the guy who's come with me.

826
01:16:27,314 --> 01:16:28,808
He's going to the casino.

827
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:37,658
Shabana.

828
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:42,126
I am Abdul Haq.

829
01:16:42,194 --> 01:16:43,569
I will take that packet now.

830
01:16:45,298 --> 01:16:47,021
Imperial hotel... will you go?

831
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:48,138
Bye.

832
01:16:50,035 --> 01:16:51,529
Come on, hurry up.

833
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:57,967
Taufiq sir always said such
great things about you.

834
01:17:40,498 --> 01:17:41,905
Stop the car on the side.

835
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:04,940
Thank you Sir.

836
01:18:26,642 --> 01:18:28,398
Sorry.

837
01:19:12,722 --> 01:19:15,592
Take a seat, I'll be right back.

838
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,078
- Hello.
- Sir, he came along.

839
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,040
What do I do?

840
01:19:45,138 --> 01:19:46,600
Keep him busy,
I'll be right there.

841
01:19:47,058 --> 01:19:48,058
Okay, sir.

842
01:20:38,162 --> 01:20:39,788
Would you like something,
Abdul sir?

843
01:23:20,498 --> 01:23:21,359
Search him.

844
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:22,458
Yes?

845
01:23:23,442 --> 01:23:25,068
- Hello.
- Yes tell me.

846
01:23:25,522 --> 01:23:26,699
Are you in a conference?

847
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:28,474
No.

848
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:30,701
Tomorrow is Ananya's birthday.
Can you make it?

849
01:23:32,274 --> 01:23:33,274
Of course.

850
01:23:33,586 --> 01:23:37,034
Call home and invite
everyone on our behalf.

851
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,137
And try to...

852
01:23:38,162 --> 01:23:40,496
Anjali, can I call you back?

853
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:43,289
Why?

854
01:23:44,146 --> 01:23:45,426
I am in the middle of something.

855
01:23:46,834 --> 01:23:49,769
I asked you whether
you're busy or not?

856
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:51,066
Sorry.

857
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:53,361
That's all you always say.

858
01:23:53,906 --> 01:23:55,183
Call me back once you're free.

859
01:23:55,922 --> 01:23:56,922
Okay, bye.

860
01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:05,197
All he's got is money,
nothing else.

861
01:24:05,266 --> 01:24:06,266
No cellphone.

862
01:24:06,354 --> 01:24:07,215
Sir, we got him.

863
01:24:07,314 --> 01:24:08,840
We're bringing him back, by road.

864
01:24:08,946 --> 01:24:10,801
Message me the car details.

865
01:24:10,866 --> 01:24:13,321
Indian Air Force will help you
out at the Sanauli border.

866
01:24:13,426 --> 01:24:15,019
Right, sir. Thank you.

867
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:16,303
Inject him.

868
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:17,370
Okay sir.

869
01:25:06,834 --> 01:25:07,913
Where's Javed?

870
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:15,371
14 Raybury Road, William Dock?

871
01:25:15,442 --> 01:25:16,871
Did you record it - Yes, sir.

872
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:22,810
What do you think?

873
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:25,642
I don't know sir.

874
01:25:26,898 --> 01:25:28,491
We don't have time, Ajay.

875
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:30,713
I'll try.

876
01:25:32,274 --> 01:25:33,484
Bring me the stuff.

877
01:25:43,122 --> 01:25:44,122
What's this?

878
01:25:44,658 --> 01:25:45,658
Rod.

879
01:25:46,993 --> 01:25:47,993
And that?

880
01:25:48,049 --> 01:25:49,049
Gel.

881
01:25:52,753 --> 01:25:53,833
Wait. Wait.

882
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:55,369
Hold on, please.

883
01:25:56,018 --> 01:25:58,254
Look... l am a businessman.

884
01:25:58,898 --> 01:26:00,498
You guys keep beating
me up all the time.

885
01:26:00,818 --> 01:26:02,411
First that Madam thrashed me, now you.

886
01:26:02,865 --> 01:26:04,491
Ask me what you want to know.

887
01:26:05,106 --> 01:26:06,106
Ask me.

888
01:26:09,842 --> 01:26:10,842
Where's Bilal?

889
01:26:11,634 --> 01:26:13,543
Please... please step away first.

890
01:26:14,322 --> 01:26:15,467
Come in front.

891
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:16,634
Please.

892
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,146
Look, you don't understand
what I am saying.

893
01:26:23,602 --> 01:26:24,649
I am a businessman.

894
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:26,254
We only work for money.

895
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:29,770
Where's Bilal?

896
01:26:33,202 --> 01:26:35,984
First... promise you'll set me free.

897
01:26:36,946 --> 01:26:38,801
Look, I've got nothing to do...

898
01:26:38,898 --> 01:26:41,134
with this lndia-Pakistan
or Hindu-Muslim war...

899
01:26:41,521 --> 01:26:43,627
I only give
service and make money.

900
01:26:44,337 --> 01:26:45,646
And I can be useful
to you in future also.

901
01:26:45,938 --> 01:26:46,938
You see...

902
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,625
Okay.

903
01:26:59,538 --> 01:27:00,683
Bilal is in Al-Dera.

904
01:27:01,234 --> 01:27:02,514
He's got a big meeting tomorrow.

905
01:27:03,026 --> 01:27:04,553
To finalize the
rest of the planning...

906
01:27:04,849 --> 01:27:05,929
and also funding.

907
01:27:07,474 --> 01:27:08,594
What are they planning next?

908
01:27:08,818 --> 01:27:11,152
- What are your big plans?
- I don't make plans.

909
01:27:11,762 --> 01:27:13,649
They do all that, I am just...

910
01:27:13,714 --> 01:27:15,404
- A businessman.
- Yes.

911
01:27:15,858 --> 01:27:17,003
What are they thinking?

912
01:27:18,449 --> 01:27:19,594
Have you heard of Jumbo Jet room...

913
01:27:19,665 --> 01:27:21,040
and Nanhe Mujahid?

914
01:27:22,897 --> 01:27:25,286
They will be carrying
out the rest of the plan.

915
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:36,205
I just wrote it down...

916
01:27:38,066 --> 01:27:39,145
Hold on.

917
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,286
Yes, Mr. Feroz sir.

918
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:44,397
I need to see sir?

919
01:27:44,977 --> 01:27:46,701
Sir is on a very tight schedule.

920
01:27:46,897 --> 01:27:48,839
- I suggest that...
- Mr. Gupta!

921
01:27:49,873 --> 01:27:50,873
Yes.

922
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:53,770
Come. I'll arrange for it.

923
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:55,642
Yes.

924
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:57,736
Mr. Gupta.

925
01:28:04,337 --> 01:28:05,996
I don't know anything more.

926
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:14,810
Yes.

927
01:28:21,074 --> 01:28:22,481
I told you everything.

928
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:24,651
Why did you hit me?

929
01:28:25,105 --> 01:28:26,105
Out of habit.

930
01:28:48,562 --> 01:28:49,991
Yes, sir.

931
01:28:50,065 --> 01:28:51,080
We have to go with it.

932
01:28:51,154 --> 01:28:52,154
Sir.

933
01:28:52,433 --> 01:28:53,644
I'll call you back.

934
01:28:55,186 --> 01:28:57,357
- Afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

935
01:28:57,745 --> 01:28:58,745
Good afternoon sir.

936
01:29:02,002 --> 01:29:04,303
Sir, we've found about Bilal Khan.

937
01:29:05,457 --> 01:29:07,337
And according to me,
the story goes like this...

938
01:29:07,985 --> 01:29:10,440
lndian Mujahideen and Lashkar...

939
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:11,913
were jointly planning an attack.

940
01:29:12,145 --> 01:29:13,901
But suddenly Bilal
Khan got apprehended.

941
01:29:14,578 --> 01:29:17,261
Lashkar's leaders still
Wanted to execute the plan.

942
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:21,097
But lM wanted to
free Bilal Khan first.

943
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:24,518
So... Wasim mobilizes
funds from Nepal.

944
01:29:24,977 --> 01:29:26,952
Javed comes down to
lndia from Pakistan.

945
01:29:27,282 --> 01:29:31,024
And with his help,
Bilal Khan escapes.

946
01:29:31,697 --> 01:29:33,486
But the threat still looms, sir.

947
01:29:34,513 --> 01:29:36,139
Now if we want to stop them...

948
01:29:36,593 --> 01:29:39,015
we'll need to stop Bilal Khan?

949
01:29:39,377 --> 01:29:40,522
What were they planning?

950
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,054
We've intel that Bilal Khan...

951
01:29:42,705 --> 01:29:45,804
will activate a unit of
Lashkar's Jumbo Jet Room.

952
01:29:46,097 --> 01:29:47,439
Tell me more of this.

953
01:29:47,665 --> 01:29:51,048
Sir, Jumbo Jet Room is
Lashkar's aerial attack unit...

954
01:29:51,218 --> 01:29:52,679
and it's based in Karachi.

955
01:29:53,202 --> 01:29:55,057
There are about 150 men in this unit.

956
01:29:55,314 --> 01:29:58,892
Pilots, mercenaries,
para-troopers... and what not.

957
01:29:59,121 --> 01:30:03,758
They can attack in any form right
from 9/11 to fedayeen type attacks.

958
01:30:04,241 --> 01:30:05,354
Ajay, will you?

959
01:30:05,553 --> 01:30:07,441
Sir, our ex-officer Jamal,
warned me...

960
01:30:07,794 --> 01:30:10,511
that this year there is
going to be lot of fireworks.

961
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:14,159
Jamad-Ud-Dawa publishes
a fortnightly magazine, for kids.

962
01:30:14,225 --> 01:30:15,225
Nanhe Mujahid.

963
01:30:15,537 --> 01:30:16,911
Pakistan has banned it.

964
01:30:17,554 --> 01:30:20,107
We just learned that Nanhe
Mujahid is being upgraded.

965
01:30:20,434 --> 01:30:22,092
It'll be an independent militant wing.

966
01:30:22,194 --> 01:30:23,754
Sir, Bilal's in Al-Dera right now.

967
01:30:23,954 --> 01:30:25,547
To plan the funding and chock out
the future plans for both the groups.

968
01:30:25,778 --> 01:30:29,323
Then he'll head straight to Karachi
and try to execute his plans.

969
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:32,175
They'll carry out aerial
attacks on a large scale.

970
01:30:32,273 --> 01:30:34,280
Target in all
probability-Delhi or Mumbai.

971
01:30:34,385 --> 01:30:35,465
Or maybe both.

972
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:37,305
So now?

973
01:30:37,425 --> 01:30:40,240
Sir, we have caught 3 of their
most important men in last 2 days.

974
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:42,569
We've confirmed intel
about Bilal as well.

975
01:30:42,897 --> 01:30:45,036
If we get Bilal,
then that will be a big blow to them.

976
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:46,504
Get Bilal means?

977
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:47,624
Eliminate!

978
01:30:48,081 --> 01:30:51,594
After killing Bilal,
will bring Wasim before the media.

979
01:30:51,889 --> 01:30:53,289
The message will be loud and clear.

980
01:30:53,522 --> 01:30:55,562
That we're not behind them, in fact,
we're two steps ahead of them.

981
01:30:56,146 --> 01:30:57,672
This is a big opportunity, sir.

982
01:30:58,001 --> 01:30:59,401
And I don't think
we should miss it.

983
01:31:00,498 --> 01:31:03,596
- Where is Bilal?
- He's in Saudi Al-Dera, sir.

984
01:31:03,665 --> 01:31:04,665
What?

985
01:31:05,457 --> 01:31:07,115
Are you out of your mind, Feroz?

986
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,769
I mean who do you think you are?
The Mossads?

987
01:31:10,129 --> 01:31:11,406
The idea has merit, sir.

988
01:31:11,697 --> 01:31:13,039
First Nepal and now this.

989
01:31:13,361 --> 01:31:15,750
Sir, Nepal was an extremely
successful operation.

990
01:31:15,985 --> 01:31:17,774
But Saudi Al-Dera?

991
01:31:18,353 --> 01:31:19,760
Feroz, you don't need
me to tell you...

992
01:31:19,857 --> 01:31:21,679
that this is a very dumb idea.

993
01:31:21,745 --> 01:31:24,527
It's risky,
sir, but it's not a dumb idea.

994
01:31:25,106 --> 01:31:26,862
We've a deep
asset in Saudi Al-Dera.

995
01:31:27,218 --> 01:31:30,534
And with his help,
this idea is definitely possible.

996
01:31:31,537 --> 01:31:32,911
What are the percentages?

997
01:31:32,978 --> 01:31:33,839
Five percent, sir.

998
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,017
It's a great percentage.

999
01:31:35,121 --> 01:31:36,550
I even go on one percent.

1000
01:31:37,713 --> 01:31:39,852
No, Feroz. I cannot sanction this.

1001
01:31:39,954 --> 01:31:40,954
Sir, just like Nepal...

1002
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:42,730
this will be a covert
operation, as well.

1003
01:31:43,249 --> 01:31:43,947
Nothing...

1004
01:31:44,017 --> 01:31:45,675
I repeat nothing will be official.

1005
01:31:45,777 --> 01:31:47,086
Even internally.

1006
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:49,165
If something goes wrong...

1007
01:31:49,265 --> 01:31:51,916
if something happens to Ajay then,
we do not know him.

1008
01:31:54,098 --> 01:31:55,559
Can I talk to you in private?

1009
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:57,544
Excuse me.

1010
01:32:03,569 --> 01:32:06,700
When you keep saying
in front of this officer...

1011
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:10,417
that if anything goes wrong,
we will disown him...

1012
01:32:11,121 --> 01:32:12,780
how much of it do you really mean?

1013
01:32:13,009 --> 01:32:14,219
I mean it fully, sir.

1014
01:32:34,418 --> 01:32:35,432
I am sorry.

1015
01:32:38,993 --> 01:32:43,630
We get some officers like him,
bit crazy... and stubborn.

1016
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:47,406
And all that they care about
is their nation and patriotism.

1017
01:32:48,114 --> 01:32:49,714
They don't want to
die for their country.

1018
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:51,435
In fact, they want
to live for the country.

1019
01:32:51,921 --> 01:32:54,703
So that they can protect
it until their last breath.

1020
01:32:56,658 --> 01:32:58,087
And are we doing enough for them?

1021
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:00,921
No, sir.

1022
01:33:03,122 --> 01:33:04,463
But the fact is...

1023
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:06,329
they don't even care.

1024
01:33:15,313 --> 01:33:16,622
How many men do you need?

1025
01:33:16,689 --> 01:33:18,544
One backup and a technician.

1026
01:33:18,929 --> 01:33:19,929
Take Shukla.

1027
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:22,457
Sir why are you doing this to me?

1028
01:33:29,169 --> 01:33:30,478
How many hours do
you spend in the gym?

1029
01:33:30,577 --> 01:33:31,592
Daily four hours, sir?

1030
01:33:32,241 --> 01:33:34,063
- Try you do Sudoku?
- No, sir.

1031
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:36,394
Try Sudoku for 30 minutes a day.

1032
01:33:39,409 --> 01:33:40,586
I talked to him, sir.

1033
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:41,994
He said...

1034
01:33:42,193 --> 01:33:43,175
- Good evening.
- Mr. Shukla's here.

1035
01:33:43,442 --> 01:33:44,783
- Hello sir.
- Good evening, sir.

1036
01:33:45,105 --> 01:33:46,218
Evening, Shukla.

1037
01:33:47,249 --> 01:33:49,071
Sir, I don't want
to work with this man.

1038
01:33:49,617 --> 01:33:51,657
Stop crabbing Shukla.

1039
01:33:51,857 --> 01:33:54,508
No, sir.
I don't want to work with him.

1040
01:33:54,801 --> 01:33:56,161
He always gets me in a tight spot.

1041
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:57,904
He's a reckless man.

1042
01:33:58,417 --> 01:34:01,352
I barely escaped death
in Bangladesh and Iraq.

1043
01:34:01,457 --> 01:34:03,017
It was me who saved your life.

1044
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,610
It was you who
got me in that spot?

1045
01:34:04,945 --> 01:34:06,833
He changes the entire
plan at the last minute.

1046
01:34:06,897 --> 01:34:08,238
And sc*** the entire mission.

1047
01:34:08,402 --> 01:34:09,402
I am sorry, sir.

1048
01:34:09,585 --> 01:34:11,374
It's call improvisation,
Mr. Shukla.

1049
01:34:11,633 --> 01:34:12,633
I see.

1050
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:13,962
Fine, I won't do it.

1051
01:34:14,577 --> 01:34:16,333
No, sir.
I don't want to work with him.

1052
01:34:17,298 --> 01:34:19,152
Fine, sir.
Jai and I will handle this.

1053
01:34:23,314 --> 01:34:26,248
Tarzan and Hulk will
handle this operation jointly.

1054
01:34:26,546 --> 01:34:27,855
God save the country.

1055
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:30,570
- Enough, Shukla.
- No, sir.

1056
01:34:31,281 --> 01:34:32,743
I don't want to work with him.

1057
01:34:35,313 --> 01:34:38,030
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of the crew...

1058
01:34:38,129 --> 01:34:41,424
I ask that you please direct
your attention to the monitor above...

1059
01:34:41,521 --> 01:34:43,943
as we review the
emergency procedures.

1060
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:46,800
There are six emergency
exits on this aircraft.

1061
01:34:47,121 --> 01:34:50,088
Take a minute to locate
the exit closet to you.

1062
01:34:56,817 --> 01:34:59,500
Our first job
was to provide a cover...

1063
01:34:59,601 --> 01:35:01,041
and create a
background for our team.

1064
01:35:01,137 --> 01:35:04,137
We floated a Gujarat
based oil company overnight.

1065
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:06,320
And gave it 15 years of history.

1066
01:35:06,897 --> 01:35:08,686
We even gave a background...

1067
01:35:08,753 --> 01:35:10,273
to three of
the company's employees.

1068
01:35:10,545 --> 01:35:12,912
Then in a fake mail trail...

1069
01:35:13,009 --> 01:35:14,569
we fixed an
urgent meeting between...

1070
01:35:14,577 --> 01:35:17,425
our lndian company
and Saudi Al-Dera company.

1071
01:35:17,713 --> 01:35:21,030
The Al-Dera company belonged
to our deep asset, Ashfaq.

1072
01:35:26,322 --> 01:35:28,623
Ashfaq was groomed by Ajay.

1073
01:35:29,041 --> 01:35:31,497
Ashfaq was in
Al-Dera for four years.

1074
01:35:32,337 --> 01:35:34,671
We helped him setup his business.

1075
01:35:35,314 --> 01:35:38,380
Ashfaq's job was to provide
us with local support.

1076
01:35:38,673 --> 01:35:40,167
He was very reliable.

1077
01:35:40,945 --> 01:35:42,439
He had also been
arrested a few times.

1078
01:35:42,609 --> 01:35:45,195
But every time he would
get bail inside of an hour.

1079
01:35:46,033 --> 01:35:47,374
He knew something really bad...

1080
01:35:47,442 --> 01:35:49,296
about someone really important.

1081
01:35:50,257 --> 01:35:53,836
We knew more about
Al-Dera than America.

1082
01:35:55,761 --> 01:35:57,255
Where is all our stuff?

1083
01:35:57,681 --> 01:35:58,696
It's in the bags.

1084
01:35:58,801 --> 01:35:59,816
Everything.

1085
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:01,736
More than everything.

1086
01:36:02,641 --> 01:36:05,260
Bilal's staying in a desert resort.
In the villa section.

1087
01:36:05,649 --> 01:36:07,023
Under the name of Firdaus Ali.

1088
01:36:07,505 --> 01:36:09,741
You're all booked in
room in the other wing.

1089
01:36:09,905 --> 01:36:11,399
The other details are in the bag.

1090
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:13,771
Just keep looking down.

1091
01:36:13,841 --> 01:36:16,110
And avoid the CCTV camera
as much as you can.

1092
01:37:00,241 --> 01:37:03,002
According to Wasim, Bilal's meeting
was scheduled on the same evening.

1093
01:37:03,825 --> 01:37:08,233
So we decided... that they will
kill Bilal the same night...

1094
01:37:08,305 --> 01:37:09,996
and leave for the
airport immediately.

1095
01:37:10,962 --> 01:37:14,736
Their return flight was scheduled
for next morning, at 5:30 a.m.

1096
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:35,833
- Enjoy sir.
- Thank you.

1097
01:37:35,857 --> 01:37:36,977
- Thank you.
- Thank you sir.

1098
01:37:40,145 --> 01:37:40,744
- Vijay.
- Thanks.

1099
01:37:40,849 --> 01:37:41,580
Brijmohan.

1100
01:37:41,681 --> 01:37:42,681
Rahul.

1101
01:37:42,865 --> 01:37:43,865
Good luck.

1102
01:37:50,321 --> 01:37:51,321
Here.

1103
01:38:50,609 --> 01:38:51,885
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

1104
01:38:53,361 --> 01:38:54,881
Bilal's been given very high security.

1105
01:38:55,057 --> 01:38:57,446
From the main entrance
to the individual villa.

1106
01:38:57,649 --> 01:38:59,372
46&47 is highly guarded.

1107
01:38:59,441 --> 01:39:01,034
It means, whoever Bilal's meeting...

1108
01:39:01,137 --> 01:39:02,763
is staying in 47.

1109
01:39:03,249 --> 01:39:04,176
It's not allowed.

1110
01:39:04,241 --> 01:39:05,670
Don't take pictures, it's not allowed.

1111
01:39:05,745 --> 01:39:07,239
- Okay.
- Not allowed.

1112
01:39:08,753 --> 01:39:10,989
I hacked into the hotel reservations.

1113
01:39:11,089 --> 01:39:13,675
He's meeting someone
by the name of Abbas Sheikh.

1114
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:16,070
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

1115
01:39:16,817 --> 01:39:17,817
Do you have any patience?

1116
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:20,913
Of course I have patience which is
why you are alive.

1117
01:39:21,937 --> 01:39:22,937
Good.

1118
01:39:23,121 --> 01:39:24,681
We're going to keep
it extremely simple.

1119
01:39:25,105 --> 01:39:26,599
We'll enter from the desert.

1120
01:39:26,993 --> 01:39:28,847
Wasim said that
they're meeting at 8.

1121
01:39:29,169 --> 01:39:30,769
We'll wait for their
meeting to get over.

1122
01:39:30,801 --> 01:39:33,670
And exactly an hour
later... you guys scale this wall...

1123
01:39:33,777 --> 01:39:37,323
and cross this lawn or terrace,
and enter Bilal's room.

1124
01:39:37,393 --> 01:39:38,156
And kill him.

1125
01:39:38,257 --> 01:39:41,159
Next, you two will come
back the same way you went in.

1126
01:39:41,233 --> 01:39:42,509
We'll head back to the airport,
catch the flight...

1127
01:39:42,641 --> 01:39:43,852
and head back to lndia.

1128
01:39:44,785 --> 01:39:47,021
- What's the height of this wall?
- 18 feet.

1129
01:39:48,433 --> 01:39:49,433
You'll need to climb it.

1130
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:50,863
But you guys can manage.

1131
01:39:52,209 --> 01:39:53,256
CCTV?

1132
01:39:54,129 --> 01:39:55,503
Digital... hackable.

1133
01:39:55,793 --> 01:39:57,931
- That's not the problem?
- Then, what's the problem?

1134
01:39:58,417 --> 01:39:59,417
From the desert side...

1135
01:39:59,441 --> 01:40:01,801
you will first come across
a 9 feet electrical parameter.

1136
01:40:01,841 --> 01:40:03,085
The wall comes 30 feet later.

1137
01:40:03,441 --> 01:40:05,416
I'll give you a three minute window.

1138
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:07,049
All the CCTV cameras will be off.

1139
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:10,089
And the power-supply to the
electric fence will be disconnected.

1140
01:40:10,609 --> 01:40:14,635
Mr. Shukla, you want us to
climb a 18 feet wall...

1141
01:40:14,705 --> 01:40:18,480
and cross the terrace or balcony,
cross the bedroom...

1142
01:40:18,545 --> 01:40:23,847
find Bilal, kill him and then come
out... cross the balcony or terrace...

1143
01:40:23,953 --> 01:40:25,873
and jump down a 18
feet wall in three minutes.

1144
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:28,103
We're not as fit as you are,
Mr. Shukla.

1145
01:40:30,129 --> 01:40:31,984
Sarcasm? Huh?

1146
01:40:33,297 --> 01:40:34,922
Fine, I'll give you four.

1147
01:40:36,721 --> 01:40:38,608
We'll check out at 7pm.

1148
01:40:39,569 --> 01:40:40,569
Okay sir.

1149
01:42:22,545 --> 01:42:23,545
Good luck.

1150
01:43:03,313 --> 01:43:04,313
We've reached.

1151
01:43:05,712 --> 01:43:07,338
Good. Now relax.

1152
01:44:37,553 --> 01:44:39,211
Enough already, finish it.

1153
01:44:51,601 --> 01:44:53,324
Are you going to
plan everything today?

1154
01:44:53,681 --> 01:44:55,088
You'll be dead soon.

1155
01:45:01,233 --> 01:45:04,135
Friends,
they're sitting down for a meal.

1156
01:45:39,568 --> 01:45:40,768
Now they're going to have tea.

1157
01:45:41,136 --> 01:45:42,630
We've to catch a flight.

1158
01:45:45,649 --> 01:45:46,761
Good evening, sir.

1159
01:45:46,833 --> 01:45:49,037
- Any update?
- No, sir. No update yet.

1160
01:45:49,616 --> 01:45:51,136
It's too late,
I think we should abort.

1161
01:45:51,504 --> 01:45:52,552
Patch me.

1162
01:45:54,961 --> 01:45:55,822
What do we do?

1163
01:45:55,921 --> 01:45:58,255
- Sir, we'll wait.
- Sir, we'll miss our flight.

1164
01:45:58,353 --> 01:46:00,175
If we stay,
and our cover will be blown.

1165
01:46:00,273 --> 01:46:01,134
Sir, we'll wait.

1166
01:46:01,233 --> 01:46:02,575
Sir, when their
meeting is going to end...

1167
01:46:02,672 --> 01:46:04,134
when will they
go to sleep, and when?

1168
01:46:04,209 --> 01:46:05,551
We have to do it someplace else, sir.

1169
01:46:05,617 --> 01:46:06,827
Let's wait for a while, sir.

1170
01:46:07,345 --> 01:46:08,345
There he goes again, sir.

1171
01:46:08,432 --> 01:46:10,287
I told you... l mean...

1172
01:46:10,384 --> 01:46:13,134
Shukla, we'll wait
for 10 more minutes.

1173
01:46:13,297 --> 01:46:14,409
- Bye.
- Yes sir.

1174
01:46:15,633 --> 01:46:17,575
I knew this would happen.

1175
01:46:17,649 --> 01:46:19,504
Working with you, means sc***

1176
01:46:25,521 --> 01:46:26,568
What happened?

1177
01:46:30,033 --> 01:46:31,080
The meeting's finished.

1178
01:46:31,408 --> 01:46:32,455
We can still do this.

1179
01:46:32,528 --> 01:46:34,248
Mr. Shukla,
we won't wait for them to sleep.

1180
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:36,833
As soon as Bilal's guests leave,
the room and he's alone...

1181
01:46:36,849 --> 01:46:37,849
we'll go in.

1182
01:46:37,872 --> 01:46:39,334
No, Ajay. No.

1183
01:46:39,504 --> 01:46:41,446
- Ajay please come back.
- Come on.

1184
01:46:41,776 --> 01:46:43,151
Mr. Shukla, we've started walking.

1185
01:46:43,921 --> 01:46:45,001
The rest is in your hands.

1186
01:46:45,104 --> 01:46:47,373
This is exactly why I don't
want to work with him.

1187
01:47:33,808 --> 01:47:34,921
Oh no.

1188
01:47:58,608 --> 01:47:59,786
Someone switched the power back on.

1189
01:47:59,857 --> 01:48:01,657
Don't shut it off now,
they'll get suspicious.

1190
01:51:05,328 --> 01:51:06,986
Sir, it's Maulana..

1191
01:51:07,728 --> 01:51:08,728
Oh no!

1192
01:52:00,017 --> 01:52:01,497
That mean Bilal came
here to meet him.

1193
01:52:02,928 --> 01:52:04,422
- Guys, all okay?
- Yeah, okay.

1194
01:52:04,496 --> 01:52:05,609
Job done, we're on our way.

1195
01:52:05,681 --> 01:52:07,241
Good, hurry up.

1196
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,793
- Let's take him along.
- But, sir...

1197
01:52:14,576 --> 01:52:15,786
Shall we tell Shukla sir?

1198
01:52:16,337 --> 01:52:17,482
If we tell him,
he will never disconnect...

1199
01:52:17,553 --> 01:52:19,193
the power-supply
of the electric fence.

1200
01:52:19,632 --> 01:52:21,159
He won't let us out.

1201
01:52:22,768 --> 01:52:23,978
- Search him.
- Okay sir.

1202
01:52:27,024 --> 01:52:29,413
You know, I was saying...

1203
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,520
See...

1204
01:52:30,896 --> 01:52:32,303
He's already asleep.

1205
01:52:54,448 --> 01:52:55,877
Disconnect the power.

1206
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,200
Power off.

1207
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,447
Sir, he's gone crazy.

1208
01:53:53,808 --> 01:53:55,448
He found the Maulana,
but didn't kill him.

1209
01:53:55,632 --> 01:53:56,908
In fact, he brought him along.

1210
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,083
And now he's insisting
on bringing him to lndia.

1211
01:53:59,216 --> 01:54:01,769
Sir, please tell him to
get rid of him and finish this.

1212
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,335
Give the phone to Ajay.

1213
01:54:03,664 --> 01:54:04,664
Okay, sir.

1214
01:54:04,848 --> 01:54:05,993
- Shukla.
- Talk to him.

1215
01:54:06,992 --> 01:54:07,992
Sir.

1216
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,836
- Are you sure it's him?
- Yes sir.

1217
01:54:10,992 --> 01:54:11,992
What have you thought?

1218
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,607
We could've spent
all our lives, but...

1219
01:54:13,712 --> 01:54:15,119
never got our hands on him.

1220
01:54:15,184 --> 01:54:16,184
Sir, he knows a lot.

1221
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,240
This is the mother lode.

1222
01:54:17,296 --> 01:54:19,401
We need to get him
to lndia at any cost.

1223
01:54:19,952 --> 01:54:22,505
- But how?
- I don't know, I need some time.

1224
01:54:22,576 --> 01:54:23,950
These two will be leaving as planned.

1225
01:54:24,016 --> 01:54:25,260
I'll contact you again.

1226
01:54:25,328 --> 01:54:26,473
- But...
- He's right, sir.

1227
01:54:26,576 --> 01:54:27,689
Jai and I are leaving.

1228
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,062
If he wants to stay here with his
new friend, then that's his decision.

1229
01:54:30,448 --> 01:54:33,830
Ajay, if we can get him...

1230
01:54:33,936 --> 01:54:35,081
Sir, I'll try my best.

1231
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,961
This is going to be
our biggest success, Ajay.

1232
01:54:38,032 --> 01:54:39,032
Yes sir.

1233
01:54:39,088 --> 01:54:40,102
Come on, guys, let's go.

1234
01:54:47,472 --> 01:54:48,472
Oh no!

1235
01:55:25,808 --> 01:55:27,117
Okay, bye.

1236
01:55:28,016 --> 01:55:29,161
Sir, I want to stay.

1237
01:55:30,384 --> 01:55:31,628
Jai, just go get lost.

1238
01:55:31,696 --> 01:55:33,125
No, sir. I'll stay.

1239
01:55:33,616 --> 01:55:34,794
Just go.

1240
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,037
He's right for a change.

1241
01:55:37,648 --> 01:55:39,174
Sir, please... I'll stay.

1242
01:55:39,407 --> 01:55:40,902
- Jai, just go now.
- No, sir.

1243
01:55:40,975 --> 01:55:41,674
I am not leaving.

1244
01:55:41,776 --> 01:55:43,238
I'm not leaving alone you like this.

1245
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,247
Look how you spoiled him.

1246
01:55:47,472 --> 01:55:48,912
Now he's going to die here with you.

1247
01:55:51,344 --> 01:55:52,521
You can leave.

1248
01:55:55,792 --> 01:55:58,213
Okay, guys... have fun!

1249
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,000
I said I didn't want to work with you.

1250
01:56:17,392 --> 01:56:18,799
Now I am stuck in this too.

1251
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:20,265
Why? What's wrong?

1252
01:56:22,064 --> 01:56:23,754
This isn't Hulk and
Tarzan's cup of tea.

1253
01:56:24,112 --> 01:56:25,519
You will need me.

1254
01:56:25,743 --> 01:56:26,743
Let's go.

1255
01:56:51,024 --> 01:56:52,136
- Hello.
- Yes Ajay.

1256
01:56:52,944 --> 01:56:54,285
Ashfaq there is a situation.

1257
01:57:47,536 --> 01:57:48,536
F*** man.

1258
01:57:48,816 --> 01:57:50,190
He'll look even poorer.

1259
01:57:50,544 --> 01:57:52,071
He'll look pitiable now.

1260
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,767
- Jai, get the razor and get started.
- Okay.

1261
01:57:56,208 --> 01:57:57,288
Any plans, Mr. Shukla?

1262
01:57:57,712 --> 01:57:58,889
Can I get a cup of tea?

1263
01:57:59,312 --> 01:58:00,327
I have a headache.

1264
01:58:00,656 --> 01:58:02,183
And after tea I need to go.

1265
01:58:02,768 --> 01:58:04,109
Do you have a loo or not?

1266
01:58:23,792 --> 01:58:26,639
- Greetings, I am from house-keeping.
- Wait.

1267
01:58:27,311 --> 01:58:28,522
Come after half an hour.

1268
01:58:35,855 --> 01:58:37,863
Ashfaq, we'll take
the 6 o'clock flight.

1269
01:58:38,512 --> 01:58:39,832
But how will you get out of here?

1270
01:58:40,272 --> 01:58:41,272
Well...

1271
01:58:42,256 --> 01:58:43,401
Medical tourism.

1272
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,840
Ashfaq, you'll have to come with us.

1273
01:58:45,903 --> 01:58:47,659
We'll need a local resident.

1274
01:58:47,727 --> 01:58:48,971
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

1275
01:58:49,424 --> 01:58:50,424
Patience.

1276
01:58:51,536 --> 01:58:54,253
Ashfaq, imagine that you've a uncle.

1277
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:56,975
And your uncle's been
sick for a long time.

1278
01:58:57,264 --> 01:58:59,020
You applied in
a hospital in Chennai...

1279
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:00,600
but your application's in a queue.

1280
01:59:00,976 --> 01:59:03,561
Suddenly your uncle's
condition gets critical today.

1281
01:59:03,632 --> 01:59:06,480
And coincidentally... you receive
a mail from a Chennai Hospital...

1282
01:59:06,544 --> 01:59:07,656
that the donor's ready.

1283
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,022
Bring your patient,
we'll give him a last minute entry.

1284
01:59:11,312 --> 01:59:12,712
We will have to cover and create...

1285
01:59:12,752 --> 01:59:14,213
lot of fake paper trail.

1286
01:59:14,288 --> 01:59:15,608
But that's the only way possible.

1287
01:59:18,512 --> 01:59:19,788
Ashfaq.

1288
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:23,847
You're really good, man.

1289
01:59:24,047 --> 01:59:26,316
On some days... I'm even better.

1290
01:59:27,343 --> 01:59:28,620
Just one problem.

1291
01:59:29,136 --> 01:59:30,314
My uncle's visa.

1292
01:59:30,415 --> 01:59:31,415
That will be done.

1293
01:59:31,631 --> 01:59:33,038
Mr. Shukla, you don't understand.

1294
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:35,054
Even if I manage to get a visa...

1295
01:59:35,375 --> 01:59:37,797
my uncle would need a
health inspection for his visa,

1296
01:59:38,064 --> 01:59:39,471
From the local civic authorities.

1297
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,738
First, the uncle will have
to go through a health inspection.

1298
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,520
The health inspector will examine him.

1299
01:59:43,696 --> 01:59:45,216
Next he'll give his
approval on a form.

1300
01:59:45,296 --> 01:59:46,725
Only then will he get the visa.

1301
01:59:47,184 --> 01:59:49,191
And at the airport,
right from the check-in...

1302
01:59:49,488 --> 01:59:53,449
to paramedics, this form
will be checked at every point.

1303
01:59:53,552 --> 01:59:55,462
You mean we'll have
to admit him in a hospital.

1304
01:59:55,535 --> 01:59:56,535
Yes.

1305
01:59:56,784 --> 01:59:59,337
But we won't know who they
will be sending from the Civic.

1306
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:00,781
The embassy can call it
an emergency...

1307
02:00:00,848 --> 02:00:02,091
and make it a priority case.

1308
02:00:02,384 --> 02:00:04,359
But they cannot control
who comes from the Civic.

1309
02:00:06,128 --> 02:00:08,997
Can your doctor make
a backdated case history?

1310
02:00:09,071 --> 02:00:11,275
Yes. I can manage
the hospital and the doctor.

1311
02:00:11,824 --> 02:00:13,547
Fine, make it fool-proof.

1312
02:00:13,808 --> 02:00:14,637
It should be a busy hospital...

1313
02:00:14,735 --> 02:00:15,975
and make it the corner room.

1314
02:00:16,176 --> 02:00:17,321
We'll handle the rest.

1315
02:00:18,063 --> 02:00:19,111
Are you sure?

1316
02:00:19,631 --> 02:00:21,671
Because if we caught
in his health inspection...

1317
02:00:21,903 --> 02:00:23,278
then there's a square in Dera.

1318
02:00:23,727 --> 02:00:25,582
People call it the Chop-Chop Square.

1319
02:00:26,255 --> 02:00:27,815
Public executions
are carried out there.

1320
02:00:28,271 --> 02:00:30,693
- And we'll be...
- Mr. Shukla, start your work.

1321
02:00:30,799 --> 02:00:32,904
What's this about a Chop-Chop Square?

1322
02:00:32,975 --> 02:00:34,023
Nothing, he's just joking.

1323
02:00:34,256 --> 02:00:35,979
Tell him I don't like such jokes.

1324
02:00:36,592 --> 02:00:37,592
Okay.

1325
02:00:37,967 --> 02:00:38,967
Chop-Chop Square.

1326
02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:40,552
I said he'll get me...

1327
02:00:50,511 --> 02:00:51,405
Yes, Shukla.

1328
02:00:51,504 --> 02:00:53,097
Sir, we need visas for lndia.

1329
02:00:53,712 --> 02:00:55,403
And we'll also require lots of cash.

1330
02:00:55,663 --> 02:00:57,518
I'll text you a name and number.

1331
02:00:57,968 --> 02:00:59,212
He'll take care of everything.

1332
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,327
No questions asked.

1333
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,415
Okay, sir.

1334
02:01:01,615 --> 02:01:02,859
Good you stayed, Shukla.

1335
02:01:03,951 --> 02:01:04,966
Bye, sir.

1336
02:01:07,248 --> 02:01:09,517
Mr. Mathur, how are you?

1337
02:01:11,152 --> 02:01:12,199
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1338
02:01:12,272 --> 02:01:14,061
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1339
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:15,883
Why isn't Bilal came outside.

1340
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,774
How long since anyone opened the door?

1341
02:01:25,871 --> 02:01:27,660
It's been 8 hours.

1342
02:01:32,432 --> 02:01:33,544
Sir!

1343
02:01:35,696 --> 02:01:36,808
Sir!

1344
02:01:38,767 --> 02:01:39,978
Sir!

1345
02:01:42,191 --> 02:01:43,402
Sir!

1346
02:01:45,008 --> 02:01:46,088
Housekeeping!

1347
02:01:50,127 --> 02:01:51,207
Yes, sir. How may I help you?

1348
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:52,280
Please unlock the door.

1349
02:01:52,751 --> 02:01:53,766
Sure sir.

1350
02:01:54,352 --> 02:01:55,352
Please.

1351
02:01:56,591 --> 02:01:57,591
Bilal sir.

1352
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:00,869
Bilal sir, where are you?

1353
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:04,264
Sir.

1354
02:02:11,247 --> 02:02:12,327
Sir where are you?

1355
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,130
Bilal sir...

1356
02:03:08,112 --> 02:03:10,894
Dear Viewers I'm
at the murder scene...

1357
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,749
where a male dead body was found...
his age is around 43 years...

1358
02:03:15,823 --> 02:03:18,245
and his name is
reportedly mentioned...

1359
02:03:18,351 --> 02:03:20,806
as Bilal Khan,
he was killed by gun shots.

1360
02:03:20,912 --> 02:03:24,654
No authority has
announced any details regarding.

1361
02:03:24,752 --> 02:03:28,265
Once we get the details
we will let you know.

1362
02:04:06,992 --> 02:04:08,301
- All right.
- Thank you.

1363
02:04:08,367 --> 02:04:09,196
Thank you.

1364
02:04:09,264 --> 02:04:10,264
Come.

1365
02:04:11,823 --> 02:04:12,838
Hello, sir.

1366
02:04:12,975 --> 02:04:14,350
Serious medical condition.

1367
02:04:14,416 --> 02:04:16,376
We need to travel to
lndia for a liver transplant.

1368
02:04:21,647 --> 02:04:22,857
Okay, sit down.

1369
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,807
Greeting sir.

1370
02:04:45,359 --> 02:04:46,374
Come here.

1371
02:05:24,559 --> 02:05:25,420
There's a someone outside who says...

1372
02:05:25,519 --> 02:05:27,406
that the gentlemen in
the adjoining room is missing.

1373
02:05:27,472 --> 02:05:28,551
This is his passport.

1374
02:05:30,127 --> 02:05:32,200
I want passport copies
of all the guests...

1375
02:05:32,303 --> 02:05:34,954
who checked-in or checked-out
in the last 48 hours.

1376
02:05:35,056 --> 02:05:37,325
And what is the status
on the CCTVfootage?

1377
02:05:37,424 --> 02:05:40,107
The seven cameras stopped
recording yesterday at 8:30.

1378
02:05:42,703 --> 02:05:45,932
He isn't Abbas Sheikh,
nor is he from Kuwait.

1379
02:05:46,832 --> 02:05:48,206
Check our database.

1380
02:05:49,487 --> 02:05:52,651
We had three may be four unwanted
guests here today.

1381
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:53,719
- Sir.
- Sir.

1382
02:06:09,968 --> 02:06:11,975
Be careful... Be careful...

1383
02:06:12,079 --> 02:06:12,908
Ashfaq.

1384
02:06:13,007 --> 02:06:14,981
The inspector's reaching
the hospital at 3 pm.

1385
02:06:15,055 --> 02:06:16,746
- And there's bad news.
- What?

1386
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,520
Bilal's murder case is being
investigated by Hani Mohammad.

1387
02:06:19,727 --> 02:06:21,254
He's already asked for
the last 48 hours details of..

1388
02:06:21,327 --> 02:06:23,783
Check-in and check-out
along with passport details.

1389
02:06:24,143 --> 02:06:25,623
And they're also looking at the CCTV.

1390
02:06:25,903 --> 02:06:27,725
I've already misplaced your details.

1391
02:06:28,175 --> 02:06:29,255
But Hani is brilliant.

1392
02:06:29,455 --> 02:06:32,041
If only ours is missing,
we'll be easy suspects.

1393
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:35,150
Ask your contact to
misplace a few more contacts.

1394
02:06:35,215 --> 02:06:36,328
We need a little time.

1395
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,920
- Okay, where are you?
- Exchange point.

1396
02:06:39,247 --> 02:06:40,971
- See you at the hospital.
- Okay.

1397
02:06:42,608 --> 02:06:43,240
Yes, Sameer.

1398
02:06:43,312 --> 02:06:45,100
Sir, the Chennai Hospital
website has been hacked.

1399
02:06:45,199 --> 02:06:45,995
We're ready.

1400
02:06:46,063 --> 02:06:47,663
Put a Chennai's
simcard in a cellphone...

1401
02:06:47,727 --> 02:06:48,937
and keep it ready for use.

1402
02:06:49,487 --> 02:06:50,534
The same number should be mentioned...

1403
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:51,960
in the verification mail as well.

1404
02:06:52,047 --> 02:06:54,317
- Tap the Chennai Hospital landlines.
- Okay.

1405
02:06:54,384 --> 02:06:55,431
And if there's any call from Saudi...

1406
02:06:55,503 --> 02:06:57,291
then it should be
diverted to you first.

1407
02:06:57,647 --> 02:06:58,647
Got it, sir.

1408
02:06:58,959 --> 02:06:59,853
You two leave.

1409
02:06:59,919 --> 02:07:01,708
Check-in and handle Chennai and Delhi.

1410
02:07:01,808 --> 02:07:03,408
Ashfaq and I will
handle everything here.

1411
02:07:03,632 --> 02:07:04,744
We'll meet in the flight.

1412
02:07:05,007 --> 02:07:07,341
Jai, you know what to
do if you two are caught?

1413
02:07:07,663 --> 02:07:08,663
Yes, sir.

1414
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:10,854
You scared the s** out of me again.

1415
02:07:11,183 --> 02:07:12,328
What's your problem?

1416
02:07:13,519 --> 02:07:14,519
Best of luck.

1417
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:50,187
Excuse me, sir.

1418
02:07:50,255 --> 02:07:51,466
Maulana Sayed Mohammad Rehman.

1419
02:07:51,535 --> 02:07:54,218
LeT Pakistan. Carries a
bounty of 10 million on his head.

1420
02:07:54,735 --> 02:07:55,735
And the deceased?

1421
02:07:55,919 --> 02:07:56,748
Bilal Khan.

1422
02:07:56,815 --> 02:07:59,303
Belongs to a terrorist
group called lM in lndia.

1423
02:08:01,743 --> 02:08:03,630
Take out all foreigners from the pile.

1424
02:08:04,112 --> 02:08:06,283
I only want to know about the
lndian and Pakistani guests.

1425
02:08:06,384 --> 02:08:07,384
- Okay sir.
- Quick.

1426
02:08:17,839 --> 02:08:18,439
Hello Ajay.

1427
02:08:18,512 --> 02:08:19,722
I'm in the conference,
I'll call you later.

1428
02:08:20,143 --> 02:08:23,438
Be careful.

1429
02:08:24,047 --> 02:08:25,902
Be careful.

1430
02:08:32,591 --> 02:08:33,606
Come.

1431
02:09:01,487 --> 02:09:03,243
One... two... three, go.

1432
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:04,519
Thank you very much.

1433
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:54,359
- Greetings.
- Hello.

1434
02:09:54,543 --> 02:09:56,169
Hi, I am looking for a patient.
His name's Aarif Sheikh.

1435
02:09:56,271 --> 02:09:57,271
Excuse me, sir.

1436
02:09:58,223 --> 02:10:00,394
- Are you looking for Aarif Sheikh?
- Yes.

1437
02:10:00,623 --> 02:10:01,965
He happens to be my uncle.

1438
02:10:02,063 --> 02:10:03,852
- Please come with me.
- Okay, let's go.

1439
02:10:39,471 --> 02:10:40,486
- Come, this way.
- Okay.

1440
02:11:58,703 --> 02:11:59,980
Zakaat certificate?

1441
02:12:03,535 --> 02:12:05,258
Letter of admission from the hospital.

1442
02:12:07,919 --> 02:12:10,057
- Please call the doctor on duty.
- Yes.

1443
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:32,119
Sir, it's here.

1444
02:12:32,271 --> 02:12:33,271
Hold, Sameer.

1445
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:35,882
We're lndians and
we have a reputation.

1446
02:12:36,143 --> 02:12:38,118
If we send a prompt reply,
they'll get suspicious.

1447
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:39,319
Wait.

1448
02:12:44,015 --> 02:12:45,422
- Hello.

Now, send it.

Inspector, can I get your signature.

1461

Thank you.

1463

Show me the form.

1464
02:14:48,335 --> 02:14:49,796
You can show this at the embassy.

1465
02:14:50,191 --> 02:14:51,238
They will issue the visa.

1466
02:14:51,343 --> 02:14:51,790
Okay?

1467
02:14:51,855 --> 02:14:52,870
- Thank you very much.
- Welcome.

1468
02:14:52,943 --> 02:14:53,943
Please.

1469
02:14:56,943 --> 02:14:57,943
Thank you.

1470
02:15:04,815 --> 02:15:05,815
Ajay.

1471
02:15:09,423 --> 02:15:11,245
Oh no. How did his happen?

1472
02:15:16,847 --> 02:15:17,847
Sit here.

1473
02:15:20,014 --> 02:15:21,094
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1474
02:15:21,967 --> 02:15:22,967
Show it to me.

1475
02:15:23,119 --> 02:15:24,119
Let it be.

1476
02:15:24,335 --> 02:15:25,545
Call your doctor.

1477
02:15:26,031 --> 02:15:28,813
- And my bag's in the van downstairs, get that.
- I'll get it.

1478
02:15:42,798 --> 02:15:43,798
Freeze A7.

1479
02:15:46,638 --> 02:15:48,067
Zoom into the car plate.

1480
02:15:50,191 --> 02:15:51,336
Find me this van.

1481
02:16:19,951 --> 02:16:20,714
Hello.

1482
02:16:20,879 --> 02:16:22,279
Sir, we're leaving for the airport.

1483
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:24,100
You'll have in-flight support.

1484
02:16:33,391 --> 02:16:35,016
I just wrote it down...

1485
02:16:37,166 --> 02:16:38,166
Hold on.

1486
02:16:40,431 --> 02:16:41,431
Yes, Feroz sir.

1487
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:43,108
I need to see the Minister.

1488
02:16:43,855 --> 02:16:45,546
It's really impossible today.

1489
02:16:45,902 --> 02:16:47,015
Is it very urgent?

1490
02:16:51,406 --> 02:16:52,421
No, Mr. Gupta.

1491
02:16:52,782 --> 02:16:54,277
Nothing urgent, bye.

1492
02:17:03,215 --> 02:17:05,320
- Everything okay?
- All good.

1493
02:17:13,423 --> 02:17:15,048
- Hello.
- Hello.

1494
02:17:15,470 --> 02:17:16,997
I am in a conference, call you later.

1495
02:17:17,103 --> 02:17:18,117
Ajay...

1496
02:17:23,215 --> 02:17:24,360
Are you okay?

1497
02:17:26,382 --> 02:17:27,789
Why? What happened?

1498
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:33,351
I suddenly felt very scared.

1499
02:17:34,383 --> 02:17:36,106
My heart started racing.

1500
02:17:36,815 --> 02:17:38,091
Are you really okay?

1501
02:17:40,974 --> 02:17:41,672
What will happen to me?

1502
02:17:41,742 --> 02:17:42,855
I am absolutely fine.

1503
02:17:43,631 --> 02:17:44,631
Really?

1504
02:17:45,838 --> 02:17:46,853
Where are the kids?

1505
02:17:48,751 --> 02:17:49,751
At school.

1506
02:17:51,119 --> 02:17:53,639
The conference is about to end,
see you soon.

1507
02:17:53,999 --> 02:17:55,428
See you, bye.

1508
02:17:57,231 --> 02:17:58,343
Just don't die.

1509
02:18:11,311 --> 02:18:13,732
Ajay, the air-paramedics
entrance is on the other side.

1510
02:18:13,807 --> 02:18:15,051
At Gate C.

1511
02:18:15,246 --> 02:18:16,246
Stay there.

1512
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:17,860
I'll go to the embassy
and complete the formalities.

1513
02:18:17,935 --> 02:18:18,935
We'll meet there.

1514
02:18:19,438 --> 02:18:20,438
Good luck.

1515
02:18:59,086 --> 02:19:01,836
Sir we found the van,
but no one in inside.

1516
02:19:06,318 --> 02:19:07,212
Thank you.

1517
02:19:07,278 --> 02:19:08,278
Thank you.

1518
02:19:59,438 --> 02:20:00,438
See you in the flight.

1519
02:20:00,463 --> 02:20:01,226
Good luck.

1520
02:20:01,327 --> 02:20:02,756
Come on, guys. Let's get it moving.

1521
02:20:03,118 --> 02:20:04,118
C'mon quickly.

1522
02:20:35,502 --> 02:20:36,517
Thank you.

1523
02:20:55,054 --> 02:20:56,516
- Watch where you're going?
- Sorry.

1524
02:21:30,222 --> 02:21:31,782
This is the security
system in the hotel...

1525
02:21:31,886 --> 02:21:33,991
No, I want all security...

1526
02:21:34,095 --> 02:21:36,102
Excuse me, sir, this is the helper.

1527
02:22:59,502 --> 02:23:01,673
Hey you! Stop!

1528
02:23:01,742 --> 02:23:02,887
Stop I say!

1529
02:23:02,990 --> 02:23:04,168
Hands up!

1530
02:23:06,734 --> 02:23:08,011
Turn around.

1531
02:23:26,446 --> 02:23:27,723
Hey right there.

1532
02:23:31,598 --> 02:23:33,900
- Stop! Don't move.
- Don't move.

1533
02:23:33,966 --> 02:23:34,966
Don't move.

1534
02:23:35,022 --> 02:23:37,127
- Get down on the floor.
- Leave me.

1535
02:23:37,390 --> 02:23:39,245
- Don't move.
- Hey, leave it.

1536
02:23:39,790 --> 02:23:40,805
It's not my bag.

1537
02:23:40,878 --> 02:23:42,601
- What's wrong with you?
- Take his bag.

1538
02:23:55,342 --> 02:23:57,481
Welcome sir. This way.

1539
02:23:57,934 --> 02:23:58,934
Hi.

1540
02:23:59,694 --> 02:24:01,669
- Welcome sir. This way.
- Enjoy your flight sir.

1541
02:24:04,654 --> 02:24:05,654
Excuse me, sir.

1542
02:24:20,079 --> 02:24:21,079
Hello.

1543
02:24:21,102 --> 02:24:23,142
[Speaking Turkish]

1544
02:24:23,246 --> 02:24:24,294
[Speaking Turkish]

1545
02:24:24,398 --> 02:24:26,820
I want some information on passengers,
travelling to lndia.

1546
02:24:27,054 --> 02:24:29,672
And please asked to ATC
to put all flight on standby.

1547
02:24:30,254 --> 02:24:32,742
Security to ATC, copy.

1548
02:24:33,070 --> 02:24:34,793
ATC to security, copy.

1549
02:24:34,862 --> 02:24:36,139
I repeat, copy.

1550
02:24:36,366 --> 02:24:37,959
I want to check this passport number.

1551
02:24:38,126 --> 02:24:39,370
One second, sir.

1552
02:24:40,366 --> 02:24:41,886
Can I have the
passengers list, please?

1553
02:24:41,903 --> 02:24:43,080
- Of course.
- Yes sir, Number please?

1554
02:24:43,182 --> 02:24:47,721

1555
02:24:48,623 --> 02:24:49,833
This way sir.

1556
02:24:56,078 --> 02:24:56,645
I have him.

1557
02:24:56,718 --> 02:24:58,278
He's boarding Etihad now.

1558
02:24:58,862 --> 02:25:02,659
And Vijay Sharma and Brijmohan Singh?

1559
02:25:02,926 --> 02:25:04,103
One second, sir.

1560
02:25:18,862 --> 02:25:20,651
Yes, they are all travelling together?

1561
02:25:20,750 --> 02:25:21,798
Any problem, sir?

1562
02:25:24,846 --> 02:25:28,294
ATC to security, status update please.

1563
02:25:28,686 --> 02:25:30,923
Is there someone with a
medical condition on the plane?

1564
02:25:31,215 --> 02:25:32,262
Any air-paramedic?

1565
02:25:39,854 --> 02:25:40,389
Yes, sir.

1566
02:25:40,463 --> 02:25:42,983
There's a local resident,
going for a liver ailment.

1567
02:25:43,246 --> 02:25:44,246
Any problem, sir?

1568
02:25:55,406 --> 02:25:56,715
Sir, any problem?

1569
02:26:25,006 --> 02:26:26,021
Sir, any problem?

1570
02:26:30,670 --> 02:26:31,717
No problem!

1571
02:26:32,750 --> 02:26:34,823
ATC to security-Roger that.

1572
02:26:35,854 --> 02:26:36,868
We're good to go guys.

1573
02:27:08,526 --> 02:27:10,087
Sir, the flight has taken off.

1574
02:27:32,558 --> 02:27:34,347
Maulana's capture was not made public.

1575
02:27:35,342 --> 02:27:37,513
First we found out
everything we needed to know.

1576
02:27:38,286 --> 02:27:39,286
6 weeks later

1577
02:27:39,438 --> 02:27:41,991
when he had nothing
more to tell us...

1578
02:27:42,222 --> 02:27:43,783
we took him to Srinagar.

1579
02:27:44,430 --> 02:27:46,372
Out there,
the Army treated him the same way...

1580
02:27:47,182 --> 02:27:48,426
they treat militants.

1581
02:27:56,494 --> 02:27:59,309
Baby... which was just on
a 5 year trial run...

1582
02:27:59,374 --> 02:28:00,584
was shut down.

1583
02:28:01,070 --> 02:28:03,754
And our elite program
was granted permanent status.

1584
02:28:04,238 --> 02:28:06,791
We now have fresh recruits,
and we're more than ready.

1585
02:28:07,758 --> 02:28:09,612
They keep calling us
something or the other.

1586
02:28:10,222 --> 02:28:12,361
But we love the name... Baby!

1587
02:28:35,918 --> 02:28:41,286
"The moments shiver...
time changes its course."

1588
02:28:41,742 --> 02:28:46,150
"The sun sets... on
the horizon faraway."

1589
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:52,071
"The moments shiver... time
changes its course."

1590
02:28:52,590 --> 02:28:57,892
"The sun sets... on
the horizon faraway."

1591
02:28:58,222 --> 02:29:03,340
"Silence melt away drop by drop."

1592
02:29:03,630 --> 02:29:08,420
"There are no players left... but
the game still goes on."

1593
02:29:08,494 --> 02:29:11,144
"Faces come and go."

1594
02:29:11,246 --> 02:29:14,694
"But the one that
remains in the memories."

1595
02:29:16,942 --> 02:29:19,146
"Carefree..."

1596
02:29:19,374 --> 02:29:22,341
"One that's carefree."

1597
02:29:22,414 --> 02:29:24,356
"Carefree..."

1598
02:29:24,718 --> 02:29:27,718
"One that's carefree."

1599
02:29:27,790 --> 02:29:29,546
"Carefree..."

1600
02:29:30,190 --> 02:29:33,125
"One that's carefree."

1601
02:29:49,134 --> 02:29:51,752
"Don't trust your eyes."

1602
02:29:51,854 --> 02:29:54,439
"Every sight is an illusion."

1603
02:29:54,542 --> 02:29:57,160
"Those who welcome with open arms."

1604
02:29:57,230 --> 02:30:00,165
"Stab you in the back."

1605
02:30:00,525 --> 02:30:03,013
"There's a silence in this racket."

1606
02:30:03,309 --> 02:30:05,830
"Unconsciousness in
this conscious state."

1607
02:30:05,933 --> 02:30:10,789
"Everyone will be tightlipped...
when the silences speak."

1608
02:30:10,862 --> 02:30:13,480
"Faces come and go."

1609
02:30:13,582 --> 02:30:16,429
"But the one that
remains in the memories."

1610
02:30:19,310 --> 02:30:21,252
"Carefree..."

1611
02:30:21,678 --> 02:30:24,645
"One that's carefree."

1612
02:30:24,718 --> 02:30:26,725
"Carefree..."

1613
02:30:27,118 --> 02:30:30,118
"One that's carefree."

1614
02:30:30,189 --> 02:30:32,491
"Carefree..."

1615
02:30:32,558 --> 02:30:35,690
"One that's carefree."

1616
02:30:39,758 --> 02:30:42,441
"Some plain... some very deep."

1617
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:45,063
"Secrets on my mind."

1618
02:30:45,166 --> 02:30:47,817
"There's a trap within the trap."

1619
02:30:47,918 --> 02:30:50,471
"A face behind every face."

1620
02:30:50,862 --> 02:30:53,415
"All known personalities."

1621
02:30:53,486 --> 02:30:55,941
"All sweet-talking."

1622
02:30:56,270 --> 02:31:00,907
"Don't ever try
to taste... this poison."

1623
02:31:00,974 --> 02:31:03,788
"Faces come and go."

1624
02:31:03,885 --> 02:31:07,660
"But the one that
remains in the memories."

1625
02:31:09,614 --> 02:31:11,654
"Carefree..."

1626
02:31:11,950 --> 02:31:14,983
"One that's carefree."

02:31:15,086 --> 02:31:17,290
"Carefree..."

1628
02:31:17,358 --> 02:31:20,358
"One that's carefree."

1629
02:31:20,461 --> 02:31:22,698
"Carefree..."

1630
02:31:22,766 --> 02:31:26,061
